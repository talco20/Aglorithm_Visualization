Aglorithm Visualization

Algorithm class combined with Python Algorithm course becomes a visualization project of the studied algorithms.

Files:

algo_vis.py - Main code to run the project.

draw_graph.py - Draws the graph and has the core functions for the visualization.

bfs_algo.py - Has the BFS algorithm.

dfs_algo.py - Has the DFS algorithm.

top_sort.py - Has the Topological sort algorithm.

mst_builder_and_vis.py - Builds and visualize mst kind of searches.

prim_only_graph.py - Has the Prim's algorithm.

kruskal_algo.py - Has the Kruskal's algorithm.
