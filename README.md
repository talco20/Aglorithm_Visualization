Aglorithm Visualization

Algorithm class combined with Python Algorithm course becomes a visualization project of the studied algorithms.

Files:
  algo_vis.py - Main code to run the project.
  draw_graph.py - Draws the graph and has the core functions for the visualization.
  bfs_algo.py - Has the BFS algorithm.
  dfs_algo.py - Has the DFS algorithm.
